Podcast SPA

    OVERVIEW: 
        This project is a Single Page Application (SPA) built with React (Next.js).
        The site is centered around a podcast between two hosts, where users can explore the latest episodes, learn more about the hosts, and subscribe to a newsletter.

    FEATURES & FUNCTIONALITY:
        Header:
            Contains site logo and navigation links.
            Navigation should work between sections/pages. (In my example no)

            Contains an image of one of the hosts.  
            Provides direct links to music platforms where the podcast can be listened to.
