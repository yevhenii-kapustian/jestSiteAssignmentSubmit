Podcast SPA Proposal

    OVERVIEW: 
        This project is a Single Page Application (SPA) built with React (Next.js).
        The site is centered around a podcast between two hosts, where users can explore the latest episodes, learn more about the hosts, and subscribe to a newsletter.

    FEATURES & FUNCTIONALITY:
        Header:
            Contains site logo and navigation links.
            Navigation should work between sections/pages. (In my example no)

        Latest Episodes:
            Displays onClick a list of recent podcast episodes.
            Each episode should have a title, description, and "Read More" button.

        Host Introduction:
            A section introducing the podcast host with his bio & photo.

        Newsletter Input:
            Input field where a user can enter their name & email.
            On submit, the email should be added to a subscription list (mocked).

        Footer:
            Contains site logo and navigation links.
            Displays social media links (Instagram, Twitter, Facebook).
            Displays links to listen on music platforms (e.g., Spotify, Apple Podcasts).
